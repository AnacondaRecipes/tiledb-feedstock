  summary: TileDB sparse and dense multi-dimensional array data management
  description: |
    TileDB is an efficient multi-dimensional array management system which introduces
    a novel on-disk format that can effectively store dense and sparse array data with
    support for fast updates and reads. It features excellent compression, and an efficient
    parallel I/O system with high scalability.
